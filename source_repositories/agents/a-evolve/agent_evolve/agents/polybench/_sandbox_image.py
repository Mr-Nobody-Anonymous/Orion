"""Shared Docker sandbox image builder.

A single one-time build of a small Alpine image (bash + git + the common
Python packages evolved tools / benchmark solvers need), so containers
started with ``--network none`` already have everything available offline.

Kept local to this benchmark folder (rather than a shared module) so the
benchmark carries its own sandbox definition and depends on no outer layer.
